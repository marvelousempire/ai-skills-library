# Orchestration Hierarchy — nephew is the front desk

The ai-skills-library has many products (skills, rules, agents, templates, checklists, docs). They are not invoked directly. Every interaction with the library flows through **`nephew`** — the Orchestrator Agent by Avery Goodman. Nephew reads intent and commissions the right team.

This document is the one-page map.

## The rule (RL-NEW · drafted in this commit)

**No agent in `agents/` may be invoked outside nephew's dispatch.** Every other agent in the registry has a `Commissioned by nephew` clause in its spec. The chain of command, the utility team, and (where applicable) the native swarm are nephew's three dispatch patterns — not three orchestrators.

This rule is what makes the library look "built separately, made together at the end." Each agent is a self-contained, vendor-ready spec. Nephew is the single seam.

## When nephew commissions which sub-team

| Intent fingerprint | Sub-team nephew commissions |
|---|---|
| "Where does X live?" / "What's the prior art for Y?" | **Native swarm** → `@nephew-core:researcher` |
| "Implement Y matching the rest of the platform" | **Native swarm** → `@nephew-core:coder` |
| "Audit this diff for [X]" | **Native swarm** → `@nephew-core:reviewer` |
| "Record what shipped" / "Verify the witness chain" | **Native swarm** → `@nephew-core:witness-curator` |
| "Hand off this swarm to another machine" | **Native swarm** → `@nephew-federation:federation-coordinator` |
| Any substantive change going through review-and-ship | **Chain of command** → `chain-employee` → … → `chain-director` |
| Register a plan + features + change-log in one move | **Utility team** → `ledger-orchestrator` |
| Author a migration with safety guards baked in | **Utility team** → `migration-author` |
| Auto-resolve CHANGELOG / Feature Ledger / pbxproj conflicts | **Utility team** → `rebase-shepherd` |
| Full commit → CI → merge → deploy → smoke loop | **Utility team** → `ship-flow-runner` |
| Gap audit + elevation pass after a substantive ship | **Utility team** → `post-ship-auditor` |
| Update SKILL-INDEX counts / container labels / cross-refs | **Utility team** → `count-keeper` / `label-linter` / `cross-reference-rippler` |
| Generate a new skill folder | **Utility team** → `skill-scaffolder` |
| Run the gap audit from a commit diff | **Utility team** → `gap-audit-runner` |
| Pre-commit verification gate | **Utility team** → `ship-auditor` |
| Two-part / faq-style intent disambiguation | **Utility team** → `question-decomposer` |

## How nephew dispatches in practice

Nephew is itself two surfaces:

1. **Inside Claude Code:** `@nephew-core:<role>` and `@nephew-federation:<role>` are the invocation patterns. Nephew's MCP server registers the swarm; the chain-of-command and utility agents are registered as project-scoped subagents.
2. **From the shell:** `nephew witness …` / `nephew status` / `nephew mcp start` / etc. — see [`agents/nephew.md`](../../agents/nephew.md) §"Pattern B."

Both surfaces converge on the same dispatch logic: nephew reads intent, picks a sub-team, returns the dossier.

## Pointer-not-replica discipline (RL-0046)

When an agent lives in its own repo — like nephew itself, which lives at `marvelousempire/nephew` — the library carries a **pointer** at `agents/<name>.md`, never a copy. The pointer documents inputs/outputs/safety; the upstream repo is the engine.

This is why nephew's native swarm (`researcher`, `coder`, etc.) **is not duplicated into `agents/`** of this library. It lives in the nephew package; the pointer at `agents/nephew.md` describes how to invoke it. New agents that live in their own repos follow the same pattern — see [`rules/library/add-agent-to-skills-library/body.md`](../../rules/library/add-agent-to-skills-library/body.md).
