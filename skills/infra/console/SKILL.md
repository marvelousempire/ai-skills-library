# console — homelab unified UI + control plane

One web page that shows the health of every service in your sovereign stack, plus a `Makefile` that boots / stops / inspects all of them with single commands.

## When to use

- "What's running right now?"
- "Boot the whole homelab stack"
- "Status across SEEME + GitLab + CI in one view"
- "Open the console" / "Use the **console**."
- "Make start" (this is the Makefile in this skill folder)
- Routine ops: `make doctor` for health probes, `make logs` to tail everything

## Quick start — one command

```sh
cd skills/infra/console
make ui
```

That's the whole thing. **Same command every time.** `make ui` is idempotent — it boots whatever isn't already up, waits for the Console to respond, then opens it in your browser. Re-running it later does nothing harmful (containers are already running, console process is already up — it just opens the browser again).

Want every surface in its own tab?

```sh
OPEN_ALL=1 make ui
```

To stop everything: `make stop`. Health probes: `make doctor`. Status: `make status`.

## Makefile targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`make ui`** | **THE one command** — boot the whole stack + open it in your browser. Idempotent. Same command every time. `OPEN_ALL=1 make ui` opens every UI in its own tab. |
| `make` (no args) | help screen |
| `make start` | boot every service in the stack (same as `make ui` minus the browser-open step) |
| `make stop` | stop every service (data volumes preserved) |
| `make restart` | stop then start |
| `make status` | container list + console process state |
| `make doctor` | health probes against every service (disk, docker, SEEME, Ollama, GitLab, CI, console) |
| `make logs` | follow logs across the stack |
| `make ui` | start only the console UI (assumes services already running) |
| `make open` | open http://localhost:7779 in your default browser |
| `make start-seeme` / `make start-gitlab` / `make start-ci-dashboard` / `make start-console` | per-service boot |
| `make stop-seeme` / etc. | per-service stop |
| `make clean` | remove `.console.log` files |

```

Server: 200 lines of Node stdlib (`http` + `fs` + `fetch`). No npm install. Token-based GitLab calls happen server-side — the browser never sees the credential. Page renders in pure vanilla JS, single self-contained HTML file, same aesthetic as SEEME and the CI dashboard.

## What it polls

| Service | Endpoint | Tells you |
|---|---|---|
| SEEME | `:7777/api/providers` | which AI providers are reachable |
| Ollama | `:11434/api/version` + `/api/tags` | version + model count + total cache size |
| GitLab CE | `/api/v4/version` + `/api/v4/projects` + per-project `/pipelines` | version, project count, running pipelines, 5 most-recent pipelines across all projects |
| CI dashboard | (link-only) | quick-launch link; the dashboard itself has the full pipeline view |

Polls every 15 seconds, pauses when the browser tab is hidden, click-through links go to the GitLab project / pipeline / dashboard in new tabs.

## Dockyard integration

When Dockyard is reachable at `:4321`, the console:

- Surfaces it as a fifth service card (`Dockyard ● up · Docker manager · N containers visible`)
- Adds an **engine badge** to the footer (`engine: colima ●` / `orbstack ●` / `docker-desktop ●` / `unknown`) sourced from Dockyard's authoritative `/api/version`
- Adds a Dockyard tile to the quick-launch row
- Surfaces `make engine-info` for explicit engine readouts

The `make start` target boots Dockyard first (so it sees the other containers come up). `make doctor` includes Dockyard + engine rows. Falls back gracefully — every other surface still works without Dockyard.

See [`../dockyard/`](../dockyard/) for the full Dockyard integration skill, label schema, and Docker-Desktop-to-Colima migration guide.

## Pairing

- **SEEME** — the diagram tool the console links to ([`../../visual/diagrams/seeme/`](../../visual/diagrams/seeme/))
- **self-hosted-git** — the GitLab CE stack the console polls ([`../self-hosted-git/`](../self-hosted-git/))
- **CI dashboard** — the deep-dive pipeline view ([`../self-hosted-git/dashboard/`](../self-hosted-git/dashboard/))
- **Dockyard** — the Docker manager UI the console probes ([`../dockyard/`](../dockyard/))

The console is the **overview**. When you want detail, click through.

## yousirjuan alignment

Operationalizes Categories 10 (Infrastructure & Deployment) and 11 (Governance) by surfacing them in one place. Doesn't ship new infrastructure — it just makes the existing pieces legible at a glance. The right place to put a TV in your office.

## Verification

```sh
cd skills/infra/console
make doctor    # one-shot health probe across the stack
make status    # what's running, what's not
```

Once `make doctor` is all green, `make open` → you should see all four service cards green at the top, recent pipelines underneath, and quick-launch links at the bottom.
